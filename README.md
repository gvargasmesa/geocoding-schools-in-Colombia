# geocoding-schools-in-Colombia
The exact location of all schools in Colombia is not freely available to the public, with the information being maintained by the Ministry of Education of the country. This code uses freely available information for each of those schools to try to geocode them in the face of poorly coded addresses and hard-to-reach rural schools.
